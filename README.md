# Global Weather Forecast Dashboard

This project demonstrates a web-based weather forecast dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly. The application allows users to input a location and view weather forecasts for the upcoming days, including temperature trends and sky conditions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Weather Forecast**: Retrieve and display weather forecasts for any location globally.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: View temperature trends using line charts and sky conditions using images.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple input forms to select location, number of forecast days, and type of data to view.

## How It Works

- **User Input**: Enter a location and select the number of forecast days.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Visualization**: Display temperature trends as line charts or sky conditions as images.


   In your terminal: "streamlit run main.py"

## Note

The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API for data retrieval. Make sure to replace the API key in `backend.py` with your own for the application to function properly.
